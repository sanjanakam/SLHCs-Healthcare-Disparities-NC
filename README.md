# Analyzing Life Histories: Exploring Healthcare Disparities in the SLHC

This project investigates historical healthcare disparities by analyzing personal narratives from the Southern Life History Collection (SLHC) using qualitative coding, Voyant Tools, and Tableau. It explores how race, gender, and regional identity influenced access to and experiences of healthcare in the American South.

---

## Project Overview

The SLHC contains rich oral histories from individuals who lived in the Southern United States during the 20th century. These life narratives offer insight into patterns of inequality in healthcare access and treatment. This project applies computational text analysis and data visualization to uncover these systemic patterns.  

The research highlights how marginalized communities—especially Black individuals, rural populations, and women—faced significant barriers to medical care and institutional support. The findings provide both historical context and a foundation for understanding how structural inequities persist today.

## Methodology

- Manual qualitative coding of transcripts for themes related to healthcare, race, gender, and socioeconomic status
- Text mining using **Voyant Tools** (word frequency, keyword in context, collocates, and topic modeling)
- Interactive data visualizations created in **Tableau** to explore geographic, racial, and gendered dimensions of the data

## Key Findings

1. **Race and Socioeconomic Status Intersection**  
   The analysis revealed a strong correlation between race and socioeconomic status impacting healthcare access and outcomes. Black individuals disproportionately represented lower socioeconomic brackets, which compounded barriers to institutional medical care. Lower-income interviewees, regardless of race, faced difficulties affording treatments, traveling to clinics, or obtaining prescriptions. These dual factors intensified disparities beyond race or class alone.

2. **Racial Inequities in Institutional Healthcare Access**  
   Black individuals frequently reported being denied access to hospitals or receiving substandard care. Many relied on home remedies or community healers due to segregation and systemic racism.

3. **Keyword Clustering in Narratives**  
   In Voyant, terms like “doctor,” “pain,” and “sick” appeared more frequently in interviews with white subjects, whereas Black subjects often referenced “herb,” “home,” or “prayer,” suggesting a divide in institutional reliance.

## Additional Findings

1. **Disparities in Maternal and Reproductive Health**  
   Female interviewees, particularly Black women, reported childbirth without medical supervision, frequent complications, and lack of prenatal or postnatal care.

2. **Geographic Divide in Care**  
   Rural residents experienced significant delays in treatment, lack of nearby clinics, and minimal access to licensed physicians. Transportation often determined whether care was possible at all.

3. **Themes of Resilience and Informal Support**  
   Despite systemic neglect, many interviewees emphasized the importance of family, church, and local women healers. These informal networks served as the primary source of care in the absence of formal institutions.

4. **Underrepresentation of Mental Health**  
   Virtually no mention of psychological or mental health support was found across the corpus. This absence suggests a lack of access, awareness, or cultural framing for mental health during the time period.

5. **Gendered Narratives of Pain and Work**  
   Women frequently described enduring pain while continuing labor (both domestic and fieldwork), reflecting how physical suffering was normalized within female roles.
